properties panel
    add fragment id
    select field and reference when selected in list

field - reference selection
    select reference when field is clicked + select field itself
    select reference when arrow is clicked + select field itself
    consider if field should have its own class, like a FragmentField to be selectable
    consider if reference should also reference source field

add support for validation + highlight invalid objects in red
cleanup code a little bit
consider adding some general action framework
    for one time actions, dynamic actions would just call the one time actions
    add keyboard shortcuts for one time actions where applicable
